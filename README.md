# Green Hash Credits (GHC)

**Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Credits - Tokenized Green Mining**

A Clarity smart contract that tokenizes verified "green hash power credits" from eco-friendly Bitcoin miners, enabling transparent trading and redemption of sustainable mining capacity.

## <1 Overview

Green Hash Credits creates a verifiable token economy around sustainable Bitcoin mining by:

- **Transparency**: Full audit trail for accountability and trust
- **Query Functions**: Access historical data for analysis and reporting

#### Dynamic Energy Source Management  
- **Expandable Sources**: Owner can add new approved renewable energy types
- **Source Removal**: Remove energy sources that are no longer accepted
- **Default Sources**: Pre-approved sources include solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear

## =' Usage

### For Mining Operators
1. Get verified by an authorized verifier
2. Receive GHC tokens based on your green hash power
3. Trade tokens on secondary markets
4. Redeem tokens for mining services

### For Verifiers
1. Get authorized by contract owner
2. Verify mining operations' renewable energy usage
3. Issue appropriate GHC tokens to verified miners
4. Update hash power as operations scale

### For Token Holders
1. Purchase GHC tokens from miners or markets
2. Hold as investment in green mining
3. Redeem for actual sustainable mining capacity (before expiry)
4. Transfer to other participants
5. Monitor credit expiry dates to avoid losing value

### For Contract Owners
1. Add/remove authorized verifiers
2. Manage approved renewable energy sources
3. Configure credit expiry periods based on market needs
4. Clean up expired credits to optimize contract storage
5. Pause contract operations in emergencies

### For Analysts & Auditors
1. Query verification history to track miner performance
2. Analyze redemption patterns and market dynamics
3. Monitor energy source adoption and trends
4. Generate transparency reports from historical data
